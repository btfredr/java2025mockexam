/*
    Task 2 (15 points)
    
    Write a Java program that uses nested for loops to print a diamond pattern of asterisks (*). The
    diamond’s maximum width is specified by the user as an odd number width. For example, if
    width = 5, the output should be:
    *
    ***
    *****
    ***
    *
    The program should prompt the user for width (assume it’s odd and positive) and print the
    diamond with proper spacing. Each row should be centered.
